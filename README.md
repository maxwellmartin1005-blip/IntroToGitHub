# Intro To GitHub

## Discription

This repository is meant to practice basic Git and GitHub processes as instructed by the University of Colorado Boulder's course CSCI 1000

## Installation

This is meant purely as a repository to practice Git and GitHub integration; there are no files to compile

## Ussage

I do not know why you would want to use this for anything, considering it's just a place to practice.  
But if you have a use for the files in the repository, please go ahead.
